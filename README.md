# object-detection
<br>
This project focuses on implementing an Object Detection model using deep learning techniques to identify and locate objects within images. The system is designed to detect multiple objects in a single frame and draw bounding boxes around them along with class labels.
<br>
🧾 Project Overview Implements a complete pipeline for object detection Uses pre-trained models for transfer learning Supports both image and real-time detection Includes performance metrics and visualization
<br>
Features:- Dataset loading and annotation parsing Model architecture setup (e.g., SSD, YOLO, or Faster R-CNN) Training with augmentation Evaluation on test data Visualization of predicted bounding boxes
<br>
Technologies Used:- Python TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch OpenCV NumPy Matplotlib COCO or custom annotation format
<br>

Dataset: This project uses a custom dataset or a public dataset like COCO, Pascal VOC, or Open Images. Annotations are typically in .xml or .json format and processed for training and validation. If you're using a specific dataset, update this section with its name and source.
